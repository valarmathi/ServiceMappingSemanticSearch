Mapped services with business criticality identi\\\\u0000ed provide key information to make data-driven decisions, prioritize services, and respond to\\\\nsituations as needed.\\\\nUsing Machine Learning, Service Mapping identi\\\\u0000es potential application \\\\u0000ngerprints based on discovered processes. It evaluates the relationship between these \\\\u0000ngerprints and CIs and creates meaningful connections.\\\\nThese connections are used to create an application service map, a visual representation of a service. Machine Learning has reduced this process from weeks to minutes.\\\\nAutomated Service Suggestions takes the information provided by Machine Learning and further simpli\\\\u0000es the mapping process. It calculates entry points, eliminating the challenge related to knowing where to begin\\\\nmapping an application service. It also generates a list of application service candidates. Each candidate includes an entry point as well as a set of previously identi\\\\u0000ed resources to include in the service map. Then in a few\\\\nclicks, the user can then select a candidate to create a new application service or to add to an existing service.\\\\nPrevious\\\\nChoose the right method for discovery and mapping application services\\\\nNext\\\\nDiscovery based on Predictive Intelligence\"]] https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-it-operations-management/page/product/service-mapping/concept/auto-serv-suggest.html 1/2'],\n",

For more detailed information, refer to the full topic.\\\\nIf your organization uses tags for asset management, you can use these tags to map application services.\\\\nA tag is a label that consists of a key-value pair. Your organization may use tags to categorize its assets, to enhance query and reporting capabilities. Discovery and Cloud Provisioning and Governance can discover tags used\\\\nby all major cloud providers and container ecosystems. Once the tags are discovered, Service Mapping can create application services based on these tags. Typically organizations use tagging in virtualized, hyper-converged,\\\\nor multi-cloud infrastructures.\\\\nExample of using tagging in organization infrastructure\\\\nSegment Technology providers What is tagged\\\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP),\\\\nCloud IaaS, PaaS, FaaS, CaaS resources\\\\nIBM Cloud Platform\\\\nHyper-converged Nutanix Virtual machines\\\\nContainers Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform, AWS ECS Containers\\\\nVirtualization VMware vCenter Virtual machines\\\\nUnlike other mapping methods, tag-based mapping does not require con\\\\u0000guring credentials or providing users with elevated rights. You can effectively use tags to map multiple application services.\\\\nThe tag-based discovery and mapping process consists of the following stages:\\\\n1. Discovery and Cloud Provisioning and Governance discover tags for cloud and resource CIs and then populate data for discovered tags into the Key Value [cmdb_key_value] table.\\\\n2. The administrator creates CI tag categories and de\\\\u0000nes tag keys that the categories contain. Tag categories contain tags with similar use, for example, tags related to different types of environments, if the organization\\\\nuses \\\\\"production\\\\\" and \\\\\"staging\\\\\" tag values.\\\\n3. The administrator creates a tag-based service family and selects tag categories to use for its mapping. Only CIs that have discovered tag values for the selected tag categories become part of application services. The\\\\nadministrator can narrow the criteria down by de\\\\u0000ning the tag values in addition to tag categories. In this case, Service Mapping uses only CIs that have the matching values to create application services. CIs that have\\\\nmore than one tags assigned to them, can be part of multiple services.\\\\nNote: When creating a service family for mapping services based on tags in domain-separated environment, you must pick the relevant leaf domain. Service Mapping populates tag-based services based on this\\\\nservice family only with CIs belonging to the leaf domain to which the service family belongs.\\\\n4. Service Mapping queries the CMDB for CIs with tag values that match the tag de\\\\u0000nitions for this tag-based service family.\\\\n5. Service Mapping creates service candidates based on the de\\\\u0000ned tags.\\\\nService Mapping populates tag-based services based on this service family only with CIs belonging to the leaf domain to which the service family belongs.\\\\n6. The administrator selects the service candidates to map and starts the mapping process.\\\\n7. Service Mapping adds new application services to the Tag-Based Application Service [cmdb_ci_service_by_tags] table.\\\\nImportant: Tag-based application services may not include relevant CIs, if these CIs do not have the correct tags assigned to them.\\\\n8. Service Mapping maps application services by creating connections between tagged CIs based on CI relationships. The Traversal Rules for Application Services [svc_traversal_rules] table contains information used for\\\\ncreating tag-based application services.\\\\nNote: Service Mapping includes CIs that are part of these relationships even if these CIs do not have tags assigned to them.\\\\nYou can create single tag-based application services using the Common Service Data Model (CSDM) \\\\u0000ow as described in Populate application services using tags.\\\\nTo create multiple tag-based services, follow the procedure covered in Map application services using tags with classic Service Mapping.\\\\nPrevious\\\\nPattern-based discovery in Service Mapping\\\\nNext\\\\nTraf\\\\u0000c-based discovery in Service Mapping\"]] [[\"Segment\", \"Technology providers\", \"What is tagged\"], [\"Cloud\", \"Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP),\\\\nIBM Cloud Platform\", \"IaaS, PaaS, FaaS, CaaS resources\"], [\"Hyper-converged\", \"Nutanix\", \"Virtual machines\"], [\"Containers\", \"Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform, AWS ECS\", \"Containers\"], [\"Virtualization\", \"VMware vCenter\", \"Virtual machines\"]] https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-it-operations-management/page/product/service-mapping/concept/tag-based-mapping.html 1/2',\n",

This method is referred to as traf\\\\u0000c-based mapping and it complements the pattern-based mapping.\\\\nWhat is traf\\\\u0000c-based mapping\\\\nUsing traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery is like casting a \\\\u0000ner net, allowing Service Mapping to \\\\u0000nd even those CIs that it hasn\\'t discovered using patterns. If a CI has two connections, the traf\\\\u0000c-based connection disappears after the\\\\nnext top-down discovery, and any manual or pattern-based connections remain.\\\\nDepending on your con\\\\u0000guration, the behavior of traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery varies. If discovery based on Predictive Intelligence is enabled, Service Mapping automatically adds connections to application services based on\\\\nconnection rules. Service Mapping generates these suggestions based on traf\\\\u0000c-related data from the Con\\\\u0000guration Management Database (CMDB) and on Predictive Intelligence analysis of application \\\\u0000ngerprints, CIs,\\\\nand processes.\\\\nIf discovery based Predictive Intelligence is disabled, Service Mapping automatically adds traf\\\\u0000c-based connections based on the CMDB data to application services. You may need to remove connections leading to\\\\nirrelevant CIs to declutter application services. Typically, if the connection suggestions feature is turned off, you use traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery at the initial stages of discovering application services. Disable traf\\\\u0000c-based\\\\ndiscovery after you complete discovery and \\\\u0000ne-tuning of application services.\\\\nIf pattern-based discovery runs after traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery runs, it may create duplicate connections between CIs. In that case, the system removes the connection created using traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery. The system keeps\\\\nany connection created by traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery and not discovered using patterns.\\\\nTraf\\\\u0000c-related data from the CMDB\\\\nThe system uses commands and network \\\\u0000ow logs to collect traf\\\\u0000c-related data and saves it in the CMDB tables.

Discovery based on Net\\\\u0000ow and VPC logs requires additional con\\\\u0000guration. You can\\\\nenrich your traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery by con\\\\u0000guring Service Mapping to perform data collection using Net\\\\u0000ow and VPC logs. In addition, Service Mapping has access to the TCP connection data collected by improved\\\\nApplication Dependency Mapping (ADM). Discovery performs ADM as part of horizontal discovery.\\\\nEnabling traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery in the system\\\\nBy default, traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery using commands is available in Service Mapping allowing it to use this method at all levels. You can enable traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery at different levels, from the most global to the most\\\\nspeci\\\\u0000c:\\\\nProduct level\\\\nBy default, traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery in Service Mapping is turned off. The Traf\\\\u0000c based discovery property [sa.traffic_based_discovery.active] controls the traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery at the product level.\\\\nImportant: You can\\\\u2019t enable traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery at other levels unless it\\\\u2019s enabled at the product level.\\\\nThe connection suggestions feature works at the product level. The sa_ml.connection_suggestions.active property controls this feature. If traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery was enabled in your deployment prior to Quebec\\\\nand you used it to discover at least one application service, the connection suggestions feature is turned off by default.\\\\nApplication service level\\\\nYou can enable traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery for a speci\\\\u0000c application service. In this case, Service Mapping uses this method for all CIs making up this application service, unless traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery is turned off for some CI\\\\ntypes or speci\\\\u0000c CIs.\\\\nCI type level\\\\nYou can create a discovery rule to include or exclude a CI type from traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery.

This rule prevails over the setting you choose for an application service.\\\\nRules for speci\\\\u0000c CIs take precedence over rules for CI types. For example, if you do not want to use traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery on any Apache Tomcat servers, you can de\\\\u0000ne a CI type rule disabling the traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery\\\\non the Tomcat table. At the same time, you can create a discovery rule enabling the traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery for a speci\\\\u0000c Tomcat server. In that case, Service Mapping uses the traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery only for this speci\\\\u0000c\\\\nTomcat server out of all Tomcat servers.\\\\nEnabling tra\\\\u0000c-based discovery at di\\\\u0000erent levels\"]] [[\"Table\", \"Source\", \"Used by Service Mapping to\"], [\"Flow Connector [sa_\\\\u0000ow_connection]\", \"Net\\\\u0000ow and VPC logs\", \"Discover dependencies, add connections during top-down discovery.\"], [\"Flow Services IP/Port and Statistics [sa_\\\\u0000ow_service]\", \"Net\\\\u0000ow and VPC logs\", \"Discover all services listening on ports.

For more detailed information, refer to the full topic.\\\\nIf your organization uses tags for asset management, you can use these tags to map application services.\\\\nA tag is a label that consists of a key-value pair. Your organization may use tags to categorize its assets, to enhance query and reporting capabilities. Discovery and Cloud Provisioning and Governance can discover tags used\\\\nby all major cloud providers and container ecosystems. Once the tags are discovered, Service Mapping can create application services based on these tags. Typically organizations use tagging in virtualized, hyper-converged,\\\\nor multi-cloud infrastructures.\\\\nExample of using tagging in organization infrastructure\\\\nSegment Technology providers What is tagged\\\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP),\\\\nCloud IaaS, PaaS, FaaS, CaaS resources\\\\nIBM Cloud Platform\\\\nHyper-converged Nutanix Virtual machines\\\\nContainers Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform, AWS ECS Containers\\\\nVirtualization VMware vCenter Virtual machines\\\\nUnlike other mapping methods, tag-based mapping does not require con\\\\u0000guring credentials or providing users with elevated rights. You can effectively use tags to map multiple application services.\\\\nThe tag-based discovery and mapping process consists of the following stages:\\\\n1. Discovery and Cloud Provisioning and Governance discover tags for cloud and resource CIs and then populate data for discovered tags into the Key Value [cmdb_key_value] table.\\\\n2. The administrator creates CI tag categories and de\\\\u0000nes tag keys that the categories contain. Tag categories contain tags with similar use, for example, tags related to different types of environments, if the organization\\\\nuses \\\\\"production\\\\\" and \\\\\"staging\\\\\" tag values.\\\\n3. The administrator creates a tag-based service family and selects tag categories to use for its mapping. Only CIs that have discovered tag values for the selected tag categories become part of application services. The\\\\nadministrator can narrow the criteria down by de\\\\u0000ning the tag values in addition to tag categories. In this case, Service Mapping uses only CIs that have the matching values to create application services. CIs that have\\\\nmore than one tags assigned to them, can be part of multiple services.\\\\nNote: When creating a service family for mapping services based on tags in domain-separated environment, you must pick the relevant leaf domain. Service Mapping populates tag-based services based on this\\\\nservice family only with CIs belonging to the leaf domain to which the service family belongs.\\\\n4. Service Mapping queries the CMDB for CIs with tag values that match the tag de\\\\u0000nitions for this tag-based service family.\\\\n5. Service Mapping creates service candidates based on the de\\\\u0000ned tags.\\\\nService Mapping populates tag-based services based on this service family only with CIs belonging to the leaf domain to which the service family belongs.\\\\n6. The administrator selects the service candidates to map and starts the mapping process.\\\\n7. Service Mapping adds new application services to the Tag-Based Application Service [cmdb_ci_service_by_tags] table.\\\\nImportant: Tag-based application services may not include relevant CIs, if these CIs do not have the correct tags assigned to them.\\\\n8. Service Mapping maps application services by creating connections between tagged CIs based on CI relationships. The Traversal Rules for Application Services [svc_traversal_rules] table contains information used for\\\\ncreating tag-based application services.\\\\nNote: Service Mapping includes CIs that are part of these relationships even if these CIs do not have tags assigned to them.\\\\nYou can create single tag-based application services using the Common Service Data Model (CSDM) \\\\u0000ow as described in Populate application services using tags.\\\\nTo create multiple tag-based services, follow the procedure covered in Map application services using tags with classic Service Mapping.\\\\nPrevious\\\\nPattern-based discovery in Service Mapping\\\\nNext\\\\nTraf\\\\u0000c-based discovery in Service Mapping\"]] [[\"Segment\", \"Technology providers\", \"What is tagged\"], [\"Cloud\", \"Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP),\\\\nIBM Cloud Platform\", \"IaaS, PaaS, FaaS, CaaS resources\"], [\"Hyper-converged\", \"Nutanix\", \"Virtual machines\"], [\"Containers\", \"Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform, AWS ECS\", \"Containers\"], [\"Virtualization\", \"VMware vCenter\", \"Virtual machines\"]] https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-it-operations-management/page/product/service-mapping/concept/tag-based-mapping.html 1/2',\n",

This method is referred to as traf\\\\u0000c-based mapping and it complements the pattern-based mapping.\\\\nWhat is traf\\\\u0000c-based mapping\\\\nUsing traf\\\\u0000c-based discovery is like casting a \\\\u0000ner net, allowing Service Mapping to \\\\u0000nd even those CIs that it hasn\\'t discovered using patterns.

After Service Mapping collects data, it then creates a map of application services\\\\nand stores the collected data in the CMDB.\\\\nServiceNow applications refer to devices and applications that comprise an application service as con\\\\u0000guration items (CIs).\\\\nService Mapping uses patterns to discover and map CIs.

A typical Service Mapping pattern consists of two\\\\ntypes of algorithms for identifying CIs and \\\\u0000nding CI connections.\\\\nThe starting point of any discovery process is an entry point. An entry point is a point where clients access an application service. For example, to map your electronic mailing application service, de\\\\u0000ne an IP address or host\\\\nname of the email server as an entry point. The discovery and mapping process begins from Discovery performing the horizontal discovery to identify the host.

Service Mapping creates an application discovery request for the IP address of the entry point. It then writes the request in the ECC queue and assigns a MID Server to the request.\\\\nb. The MID Server checks the ECC queue and retrieves the discovery request assigned to it.\\\\nc. The MID Server starts running identi\\\\u0000cation sections of the patterns associated with the classi\\\\u0000er to \\\\u0000nd the match for the entry point. When the identi\\\\u0000cation section matches the entry point, the pattern\\\\ndiscovers a CI.\\\\nd. The MID Server starts running connectivity sections of the pattern to \\\\u0000nd outgoing connections of the newly discovered CI.\\\\ne. The MID Server passes information on the discovered CI, its attributes, and connections to the ECC queue.\\\\nf. Service Mapping checks the ECC queue and receives information on the newly discovered CI.\\\\nWhenever Service Mapping checks the ECC queue and receives information on a discovered CI, it checks these tables for any data on outbound connections related to the CI: the cmdb_tcp and\\\\nsa_\\\\u0000ow_connection tables. If these two tables contain unique data that patterns did not discover, Service Mapping enriches the information about the CI connections and adds them to the map.\\\\ng. Service Mapping writes the information into the CMDB and adds this CI to the application service map.\\\\nh. Service Mapping creates the discovery requests for all applications to which the newly discovered CI connects. Mapping is complete after Service Mapping maps a CI that either does not have any outbound\\\\nconnections or is marked as a boundary. A boundary makes Service Mapping stop discovery from this point and not follow outgoing connections.\\\\n4. The system regularly runs the service recomputation to query the CMDB for the latest CI changes, add data for network and storage paths, and apply CI impact rules.\\\\nPrevious\\\\nDiscovery based on Predictive Intelligence\\\\nNext\\\\nTag-based discovery in Service Mapping\"], [\"The world works with ServiceNow.\\\\u2122\\\\nTerms and conditions\\\\nPrivacy statement\\\\nGDPR\\\\nCookie policy\\\\n\\\\u00a92024 ServiceNow.
